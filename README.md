# Docs to Anki (donki for short)

Now that I have figured out how creating Chrome extensions works, I will try to make the project that I actually wanted to make. I often use the app Anki for language learning. It is a spaced repetition flashcard software that improves recall by showing cards right when they would have left your memory. I like to write new vocabulary I find into a Google Docs spreadsheet and then import those into Anki. However, importing them the way I was doing it before was a bit tedious, and I figured I could try automating the process.

The goal with this is to add a context menu option into Google Chrome. The Chrome Extension will communicate with the Anki app and allow me to import new flashcards with just a click of a button.
